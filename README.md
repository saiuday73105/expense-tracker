# Expense Tracker App

The aim of this project is to create a cross-platform application that can track incomes and spendings of an individual. Through the app UI, the customer can login, see total expenses/income, add/see all their recent transactions w.r.t categories, automatic addition of transactions, and spendings' graphs/reports generated over a selected period of time.
